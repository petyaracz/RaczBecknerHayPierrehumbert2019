<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>The MGL is a java package file. It comes with a button interface.</p>
<p>MGL fits have a number of parameters. Two are relevant here. The confidence levels are always the same in the fits reported here; a lower confidence of 55 and an upper confidence of 95. We came to these values by experimentation and cross-referencing previous literature, this is not included here. You can also tell the MGL to use feature-based distance or edit distance.</p>
<p>We fit the MGL using both edit-distance and feature distance.</p>
<h2 id="baseline-mgl">Baseline MGL</h2>
<p>Replicating the baseline results is straightforward: I added the input file we used (CELEX3.in) which already has the test forms included. I added the rule set extracted by the MGL with and without features for reference.</p>
<h2 id="individual-esp-mgl">Individual / ESP MGL</h2>
<p>I'm trying to reconstruct this from my own bug logs so it might not be 100% accurate on what doesn't work. I'm relatively confident on what does work. Bugs have been reported to the package authors.</p>
<p>You can fit the MGL on batches using a batch file and a CLI. It will not, however, use feature files -- it will default to edit distance. It won't tell you this. This, I think, doesn't change even if you include feature files with identical names to the input file (the old subtitle trick).</p>
<p>The MGL with no features was fit on the esp data this way, for each participant in the reported dataset.</p>
<p>If you want features, you have to fit sets individually. You have to also have a separate feature file for each set. You have to quit and reopen the MGL each time after fit. I fit the MGL on a subset of all participants making sure that the possible input and tests lists as well as bot behaviours are all covered. I checked to make sure that the MGL predictions on the subset are quantitatively no different from the MGL predictions on the entire set of participants.</p>
